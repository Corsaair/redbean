redbean - The RedTamarin build tool
===================================

**Redbean** is a tool that allows to build, compile, run,
manipulate, organise, etc. ActionScript 3.0 projects for RedTamarin.

INSTALL
-------

The tool should be installed with the `redtamarin-sdk` package.

Later, it will be possible to update the tool independently of
the Redtamarin SDK.

NOTES
-----

Please refer to the old documentation `readme.txt`.

The current v1.1.0 is a quick patch to sync the runtime with
Redtamarin v0.4.1 and add the new projector format.

Everything should work about the same except now
we don't need to use `--` to pass arguments.

Still, this is a transition version, we are updating `redbean`
with much more functionalities, and so we need to do a full rewrite
of the command-line tools.
